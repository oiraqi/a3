# Welcome To Academix: The Ultimate ERP for Higher-Ed Institutions
*Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC) Chair*: Dear colleagues, please don't forget to include all required evidence, e.g., student evaluation reports, in your faculty evaluation file. *Faculty*: Dear FEC Chair, all student evaluation reports are available on our course management portal. For higher information integrity, it would be even better if you fetched them directly from there. *FEC Chair*: Dear colleague, unfortunately, we don't have access to those reports on the course management portal. And as you know, the faculty evaluation software is different and disconnected from course management.

*Dean*: Dear colleagues, please send me your published articles over the current year for the annual activity report. *Faculty*: Dear Dean, I have just submitted my faculty evaluation file. Please find it there. *Dean*: Yes, but that's a different process and system. Please send that information again.

*Enrollment Services*: Dear Faculty, please verify that the list of students in your sections is correct. *Faculty*: Dear Enrollment Services, how/why could/would a list of students be incorrect? *Enrollment Services*: Because some recent updates in our Roster Management System may not have been replicated on our Learning Management System.

*Student*: Dear Advisor, I would like to stop by to get my course pre-registration form signed. *Advisor*: OK, but did you prepare/update your degree plan? *Student*: I have submitted it last semester as an Excel file. It hasn't changed since. *Advisor*: Please send it again, I can't find it. Also, remind me about the program you're enrolled in and your minor, as well as your overall performance so far.
