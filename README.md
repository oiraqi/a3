*Your Dean*: Dear colleagues, please send me your published articles over the current year for the annual activity report. *You*: Dear Dean, I have just submitted my faculty evaluation file. Please find it there. *Your Dean*: Yes, but that's a different process and system. Please send that information again.

*Enrollment Services*: Dear Faculty, please verify that the list of students in your sections is correct. *You*: Dear Enrollment Services, how/why could/would a list of students be incorrect? *Enrollment Services*: Because we copy the lists from our roster management sytsem to the learning management system, and we're not sure all the recent updates in our RMS have been replicated on the LMS.
