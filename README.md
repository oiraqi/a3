# Welcome To Academix: The Ultimate ERP for Higher-Ed Institutions
*Dean*: Dear colleagues, please send me your published articles over the current year for the annual activity report. *Faculty*: Dear Dean, I have just submitted my faculty evaluation file. Please find it there. *Dean*: Yes, but that's a different process and system. Please send that information again.

*Enrollment Services*: Dear Faculty, please verify that the list of students in your sections is correct. *Faculty*: Dear Enrollment Services, how/why could/would a list of students be incorrect? *Enrollment Services*: Because some recent updates in our Roster Management System may not have been replicated on our Learning Management System.

*Student*: Dear Advisor, I would like to stop by to get my course pre-registration form signed. *Advisor*: OK, but did you prepare/update your degree plan? *Student*: I have submitted last semester as an Excel file. It hasn't changed since. *Advisor*: Please send it again, I can't find it. Also, remind me please about the program you're enrolled in, as well as your overall performance so far.
