# Welcome To Academix: The Ultimate ERP for Higher-Ed Institutions
## Common User Stories and Problems
**Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC) Chair**: Dear colleagues, please don't forget to include all required evidence, e.g., student evaluation reports, in your faculty evaluation file.<br/>
**Faculty**: Dear FEC Chair, all student evaluation reports are available on our course management portal. Moreover, to protect information integrity, it would be better if you fetched them directly from there.<br/>
**FEC Chair**: Dear colleague, unfortunately, we don't have access to those reports on the course management portal. And as you know, the faculty evaluation software is different and disconnected from course management.

**Dean**: Dear colleagues, please send your published articles over the current year for the annual activity report.<br/>
**Faculty**: Dear Dean, I have just submitted my faculty evaluation file. Please find them there.<br/>
**Dean**: Yes, but that's a different process and system. Please send that information again.

**Enrollment Services**: Dear Faculty, please verify that the lists of students in your sections are correct.<br/>
**Faculty**: Dear Enrollment Services, how/why could/would a list of students be incorrect?<br/>
**Enrollment Services**: Some recent updates in our Roster Management System may not have been replicated in our Learning Management System.

**Student**: Dear Advisor, I would like to stop by to get my course pre-registration form signed.<br/>
**Advisor**: OK, but did you prepare/update your degree plan?<br/>
**Student**: I have submitted it last semester as an Excel file. It hasn't changed since.<br/>
**Advisor**: I can't find it, please send it again. Also, remind me about the program you're enrolled in and your minor, as well as your overall performance so far.

**VPAA**: Dear colleagues, I am delighted to announce the launching of yet another software, dedicated to Quality Assurance. You will receive instructions explaining how to copy your sections from the LMS to the new Quality Assurance software, as well as how to export some material to include in your course portfolios.

## Opportunity
We can have an endless stream of such stories, let alone accounting, payroll, HR, puchasing, inventory, etc. Do they sound familiar? Does your institution too use a plethora of disconnected software systems, causing information redundancy and inconsistency? And with all these systems, does your institution still have most of its processes paper-based? Are you fed up with this situation?

Do you dream of one ultimate system that replaces them all? A single source of truth where information is never entered twice, while being readily available anytime, anywhere?
