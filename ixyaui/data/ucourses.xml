            <field name="description">This introductory humanities course is a survey of technological advances in the Middle East and North Africa in the pre-modern era. While some of these advances came about as a response to the requirements of religion (e.g., determination of the qibla direction and of prayer times), many others were practical solutions to harness the forces of nature and lead a better-quality life. Two major themes of the course are 1) to show the intellectual and technological exchanges through translations, trade, and travel between Muslims and their neighbors, and 2) to link the technologies under study to current issues by showing how past experiences and technological solutions (e.g., water use, architectural techniques, etc.) can be applied for sustainable cultural and economic development, in the MENA region and in Morocco in particular. The course consists of a series of lectures, field trips, and video projections. No prior knowledge of Islam and its civilization is required to take the course. The course can be taken as an elective in any undergraduate program.</field>

            <field name="description">If traditionally ethics asks questions about how human beings ought to relate to each other, then what are our obligations to future generations, with regard to the environment? How should we think about and treat the natural world, animals, and other non-human parts of nature? How can ethics help in the environmental policy- making processes? This environmental ethics course urges answers to such questions. It aims to raise students’ awareness about the fundamental role of ethical attitudes towards the natural environment. The course starts with an examination of original environmental ethics texts written by philosophers, progresses to analyses of case studies, and finally challenges students to solve real life environmental problems. Topics discussed include: alternatives to anthropocentric worldviews; animal rights and welfare; economic approaches to the environment; access to and control over natural resources; environmental justice; pollution and climate change; technology and the environment; and environmental activism. These will be addressed within both the global and Moroccan contexts.</field>

            <field name="description">The course explores different conceptualizations of nature, and of the human role within creation, in different religious traditions, as well as the contributions to environmental ethics developed by thinkers who assume a religious viewpoint. Virtually all religions contain an account/ conceptualization of the creation of the universe on behalf of (a) divine being(s), and some assign to human beings a role of preeminence, leadership, and safekeeping over it. Furthermore, the phenomena of the natural world are frequently mentioned in different sacred scriptures as signs of divine power and wisdom. In light of such essential scriptural elements and theological teachings, prominent thinkers, as well as ordinary believers, may feel especially compelled (and equipped) to confront the challenges brought about by technological developments in the form of environmental pollution and climate change, and debates over practices such as fracking, water management, and the preservation of biodiversity.</field>

Popular culture is often the only vehicle for common people to express social and political discontent or comment. Historically, this has been possible through popular forms of music, art, film, or literature. African popular culture is frequently global in scope with many artists known as much in Europe and the Americas as they are in their home countries. This course begins by looking at the use of popular culture in the colonial period and moves up to the present in order to look at what art is and how to appreciate African artistic production and the role of popular culture such as theater, music, film, sculpture, painting, etc. in contemporary Africa.</field>

            <field name="description">Religion has long been a factor in international relations. Since the important events of 1979 (the rise of Khomeini, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca), religion has become an increasingly salient aspect of politics, both domestically and internationally. This course will examine the role that religion plays in international relations, as well as the role that policymakers (often wrongly) imagine that it plays. It will examine the influence, perceived and real, of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the United States, Iran, and other specific countries, as well as national and trans-national religious groups.</field>

            <field name="description">In this course, we will examine that phenomenon that literary critics call “Magical Realism.” In Magical Realist fiction, the supernatural exists alongside the “real,” creating what some critics have penned “the Marvelous Real.” We will argue that Magical Realism came out of a need to balance European rationality with the myths, rituals, and folktales of the indigenous people of the New World and the cultures and religious beliefs of West African slaves, to Indigenous American peoples, and others who were disenfranchised by European conquest and colonization. We will look at novels and short stories from North and South America, as well as the visual arts that accompany them. Writers we will examine: Gabriel García Márquez; Jorge Luis Borges; William Faulkner; Alejo Carpentier; Louise Erdrich; Leslie Marmon Silko; Isabel Allende, Julio Cortázar; Clarice Lispector, and others. American Expatriate Authors in Morocco This course will analyze the work and lives of many of the American authors drawn to Morocco, especially Tangier, since the 19th century. The course will examine writers from early visitors like Mark Twain and Edith Wharton, through the mid-twentieth century with William Burroughs and the Beats, Paul Bowles and Alfred Chester, and finally to the 1970s, when writers like Dan Halpern and David Saltman took up residence. Three issues, in particular, will guide our discussions and investigations: 1) Tangier and Morocco as context and setting for authors’ work 2) the “psychogeography” of these places as a heuristic for analyzing that work 3) the ways in which these authors have ‘written’ Tangier and Morocco, that is to say, how their writings have created a particular image, character, and set of expectations about these places. The class will include a field trip to Tangier to explore the places that gave rise to works such as Naked Lunch and Let It Come Down.</field>

The three most characteristic dimensions of art will be introduced: imitation and representation, expression, and form. The students explore these topics by getting familiar with the ideas of key thinkers within major periods of Western history: ancient Greece, Medieval, Enlightenment and Modern time, and Postmodern time. The second part will focus on four categories of art forms: literature, dramatic and performing arts, music, and visual and plastic arts. Students also will critically examine and discuss various contemporary debates in Western aesthetics focusing on the relation between art and society. The debates revolve around the following themes: art and ethics, the influence of art on politics (and vice versa), art and violence, art and fashion, and art and technology in everyday life.</field>

The texts are mostly modern (excepting those from oral tradition) and represent the work of Africans writing in English, French, Arabic, Portuguese, and what are called the ‘national languages.’ Texts will include poetry, short stories, excerpts of prose, one novel, and a novella. Our central goal will be the appreciation of literature. This will include critical approaches to a) how meaning works in a text b) what literature can do for us and c) the reasons why writers write. Students will improve their skills and intuitive abilities in all these areas of inquiry. In terms of content, several areas come under continuous review: 1) What makes a work ‘African’? 2) What arguments have been made for and against an ‘Africanité’, an African ‘essence’? 3) What course - including its passage through the Négritude movement – has the prestige of African literature taken? 4) What is the contemporary worldview of many African authors?</field>

            <field name="description">This course is an introduction to Philosophy. It examines the principal themes of philosophical inquiry (e.g., metaphysics, theory of knowledge, ethics, politics, aesthetics, etc.) from both a historical and multicultural perspective. Insofar as philosophy is central to human life, its history, in different places, records the efforts of many to understand the world and our place in it. The study of philosophy therefore contributes to an understanding of some of the ideas that have shaped and that continue to shape human life even as it teaches one how to think critically about them.</field>

            <field name="description">This is an introductory course in Gender Studies. It aims to explore and analyze the concepts and theories, across disciplines, which explain the place and role of women in society. It examines the difference it makes to our understanding of the world when we put women at the center of our reflections. The course examines how the notions of “women,” “gender,” and “sexuality,” have been constructed and how these notions are related to systems of power. Such an inquiry provides a greater understanding of women’s lives and experiences.</field>

            <field name="description">This course is designed to give students firsthand field experience of major issues in the Humanities and Social Sciences. Each field seminar focuses on a specific foreign city, region, or country. The course begins as a series of lectures and workshops during a regular semester (fall or spring) and culminates in a 9- to 12-day field trip during the subsequent inter-semester break (winter break or May break), during which ix faculty and/or local experts give presentations on select topics. Topics covered vary according to the destination, but include such issues as economic and social conditions, political systems and processes, community affairs, environmental issues, development, tourism, international law, culture, and the arts. Students write a number of response papers during the semester, prepare a project or research proposal prior to the trip, and submit a research or project report upon returning from it.</field>

            <field name="description">Women, particularly women in subaltern positions or in underprivileged groups, are among the groups most vulnerable to environmental crises and injustices. This course analyzes the intricate relationship between gender, women (are they the same thing?) and the environment. It explores the role of the environment in shaping gender inequality, with a focus on the experiences of women. The environment is a powerful construct often used to reproduce and reinforce power dynamics. It has been used to subordinate and degrade marginalized groups, especially women. Environmental justice is understood in terms of gender, and of gender’s intersecting with other identity-based affiliations, such as race, color, sex, sexuality, class, religion, age etc. Women both constitute and are constituted by environmental justice. On the one hand, women play a pivotal role in advancing environmental justice and sustainability, while on the other, the environment can play an important role in advancing gender equality and women’s self-empowerment.</field>

The relationship between local communities and the state, the rise of civil society, local participation, and empowerment (of women in particular) are all considered essential to the success of development policies and projects. Issues salient to development include gender, poverty alleviation, human rights, sustainability, and the use of appropriate technology. The course also investigates the role of social scientists in creating better development plans, assisting with their implementation, and conducting follow-up assessment studies (Applied Anthropology).</field>

            <field name="description">Ethnography is one of the most important means of written descriptions of Africans, starting with the colonial period. Colonial authorities in British, Belgian, and French possessions produced a large corpus of ethnographic literature that shapes today’s image of African peoples. This course examines several of the major works from the colonial period, after independence, and finally looks at recent ethnographies by Africans about themselves.</field>

It adopts a comparative approach to Western and Middle Eastern- North African gender politics. The agendas promoted by the diverse political actors will be examined with a focus on their interaction with domestic and international politics, global economic ideologies, international development agendas, and globalization. The aim is to provide students with an understanding of how cultural and national identities, and egalitarian and (neo)patriarchal systems have appeared, have been transformed, (re-)emerged or have (re)asserted themselves in response to both Westernization and Easternization of societies, gender relations, and gender politics.</field>

            <field name="description">The notion of development has served as a complex paradigm for the understanding, evaluation, and intervention in societies, at least since the end of the Second World War. While its impact has been overwhelming in domains as diverse as economics, politics, social organization, education, urbanization, technology, etc., it has never been without its critics, both from within—in debates about the proper meaning and politics of development—and from intellectual traditions from outside the paradigm. The aim of this course is to critically examine some of these debates, from such diverse perspectives as Dependency Theory, World Systems Theory, Feminism, Post colonialism, and Post-developmentalism.</field>

            <field name="description">Gender roles and relations in the Middle East and North Africa are often viewed as being determined by either Islam, Arab culture, or both. This course moves beyond such narrow socio-religious approaches to MENA femininities, masculinities, as well as gender roles and relations. Students focus on questions of gender through the lenses of post-colonial state-building, economic liberalization, democratization, international development, and globalization. The course explores the shaping of both femininities and masculinities in MENA countries. The themes adopted in the course include colonialism and the impact of post-colonial state-building on gender relations; personal status codes/family laws; gender and social ideologies, such as patriarchy and Islamic feminism; human development; economic liberalization and neoliberalism; democratization and NGO-ization; and the debate between universal vs culturally specific approaches to women’s rights.</field>
